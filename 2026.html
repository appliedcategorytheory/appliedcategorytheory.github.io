                <h5>A Double Category Theoretic Perspective on Partiality</h5>

Double category theory provides a convenient and expressive setting in which to study functional and relational structure simultaneously. One kind of relation of particular interest is the notion of partial function, which plays important roles in many areas of mathematics and computer science. It might therefore be expected that double categories are good structures with which to study partiality. An existing category theoretic framework for studying partiality is given by the notion of restriction category, which has seen widespread application in computability theory, automata theory, probability theory, algebraic and differential geometry, logic, algebra, and others. There are multiple aspects of restriction category theory that have a double category theoretic flavour, with some explicit connections having been drawn by Paré, and by Cockett and Garner. The goal of this project is to explore the connections between these areas, demonstrating how phenomena observed in restriction category theory are consequences of general results in double category theory.

Quantum nonlocality is one of the most intriguing and foundational aspects of quantum physics. It is often studied through the mathematical lens of nonlocal games, which provide a framework for capturing and comparing nonlocal correlations. Recent work demonstrates (in passing) that these nonlocal games can be organized into a category, with morphisms corresponding to suitable transformations between games. 
						</p>

						<p>
Another line of research shows how nonlocal games can be compiled into single-prover interactive games. This project asks: can this compilation be made functorial, possibly preserving further categorical structure? By studying these constructions, we hope to deepen the connections between nonlocality, category theory, and quantum cryptography.
						</p>

						<p>
The project will begin with a categorical perspective on quantum nonlocality and contextuality, followed by studying the process of compiling games. The final phase will combine these threads, investigating if and how interactive games admit a categorical treatment that makes the compilation functorial.

          <p>Markov processes are fundamental models of probabilistic systems that have a vast range of applications. They have been studied intensively since the 1930s and have spawned a vast literature. In the 1980’s various researchers (Kozen, Vardi, Larsen and Skou) began studying Markov processes from the point of view of modern programming language theory. In the 1990s new ideas appeared with the incorporation of real-time processes and synchronization (Hillston), model checking (Baier, Kwiatkowska and others) and probabilistic bisimulation on continuous state spaces (Desharnais et al.) as well as metric analogues of bisimulation (Desharnais et al, van Breugel and Worrell). Now these topics are flourishing with many people studying them from categorical viewpoints.</p>
          
          <p>This project concerns an approach to approximating continuous-state Markov processes with finite ones. The approach we will follow uses categorical ideas very heavily and exploits duality theory. It shows how approximation and bisimulation can be understood as morphisms in a suitable category. Existing research has also shown that approximations and bisimulations are morphisms in the same category and how one can re-construct the original process as a suitable limit of the approximants. There are some open issues related to the construction of processes as suitable projective limits which we will investigate in the course of the project. If time permits we can explore the possibility of defining metrics on these Markov processes.</p>

					<p>This project has a computer science feel and background. In formal methods and theoretical computer science, we mainly deal with models of systems that are comprised of states and structured transitions between them. Such models are used as abstract representation of programs, protocols, and various reactive and dynamical systems. Comparing the behaviour of states in such systems has been the topic of lot of research. An elegant categorical framework for a uniform study of many such models is given by coalgebra, and within the theory of coalgebras there are canonical notions of behavioural equivalence. Less fundamental and more recent, there also exist different canonical notions of behavioural simulations and behavioural distances [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030439750400444X">Hughes and Jacobs</a>, <a href="https://lmcs.episciences.org/864">Hasuo '08</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-15375-4_31">Hasuo '10</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15279">Rot & Wissmann</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10732">Desharnais & Sokolova</a>]. Central to these simulations is a notion of an order on structured transitions.</p>

					The goal of this small research project is to:
					<ol>
						<li> make a clean overview of the several existing notions of coalgebraic simulations, and their interconnection </li>
						<li> focus on the recent semi-coalgebraic notion of epsilon-simulation (Desharnais&Sokolova'26) and find the minimal requirements for a coalgebraic genearlization </li>
						<li> study characteristic properties of this (and other) types of coalgebraic simulations </li>
						<li> study the necessary properties of an order on structured transitions, for suitable notions of simulation and in particular experiment with different orders. </li>
					</ol>
